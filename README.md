# 2D Fourier Transforms in Python
---
This is a repo containing my "self-annotated" code of [The Python Coding Book](https://thepythoncodingbook.com/) tutorial on how to reconstruct images using 2D Fourier transforms in Python using **NumPy** and **Matplotlib**.   

This tutorial by [Stephen Gruppetta](https://stephengruppetta.bio.link/) was a great project to play around with and only took about an hour and a half to complete.   

Please feel free to clone this repo and give it a try for yourself or take a peek at the original repo below!
